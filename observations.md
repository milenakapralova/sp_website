## Scheduling
What if someone wants to follow a standard (8wk) pace for either SP1 or SP2 but start in blok 2? For now we are assuming students would simply start as soon as possible, following either of 3 paces (relaxed, standard, fast)

These are all the possibilities for SP1 (in bold are the options we are covering in planning):
* Start block 1
  * 4 week plan
    * **start Sep**
    * start Oct
  * 8 week plan
    * **start Sep**
  * 16 week plan
    * **start Sep**
* Start block 2
  * 4 week plan
    * start Nov
    * start Dec
  * 8 week plan
    * start Nov
   
These are all the possibilities for SP2 (in bold are the options we are covering in planning):
* Start block 1
  * 4 week plan
    * start Sep
    * start Oct
  * 8 week plan
    * **start Sep**
  * 16 week plan
    * **start Sep**
* Start block 2
  * 4 week plan
    * **start Nov**
    * start Dec
  * 8 week plan
    * **start Nov**

These are all the possibilities for DP:
